# Case Studies

I hope you found the video helpful. It can seem daunting to visualize so many datapoints, or to even find the landcover for your required population count. I went an extra mile, and created two libraries which you can call to __optimally__ find desired `region-of-interest`.

The added advantage of using this library is that you can play around with the widget in your jupyter notebook, all you have to do is grant Google Earth Engine permissions to your google cloud platform so that it can render your desired results.

## SPACE

What if the Australian BushFires of 2019-20 happened in NYC.
