            <h1>Relatable Impact!</h1>
            <p>
                The outcomes of a Data Science project
                <strong>require</strong> impactful communication to the
                audience. For this project, I considered global crises that
                effected large populations.

            <h1>Principles</h1>
            <p>
                Global crises can be made more relatable by understanding the
                <strong>Psychological Distance</strong> inducing lack of
                relatability.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Psychological distance is like how far away something feels in your mind. It's not about physical distance, but more about how close or far things seem in time, space, or even emotionally. For example, something happening far away might feel less important to you than something happening nearby. It's all about how we see things in our minds, whether they feel close or far, even if they're not physically distant.
                <br>
                <br>

                For the case studies I take, I reduce psychological distance using
                <ul>
                    <li>Space</li>
                    <li>Time</li>
                    <li>Reality</li>
                </ul>
                I visually showcase this by high-contrast maps.

                <br>
                <br>

                I also use the concept of "extra-mile", which uses two principles:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrasting Clarity:</strong> When you want to show how bad something is, you emphasize it's impact with something even worse.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Relative Deprivation:</strong> When you feel like things are really bad because you compare them to how they used to be.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>

            <h1>Case Studies</h1>
            <p>
                It can seem daunting to visualize so many datapoints, or to even find the landcover for
                your required population count. I personally went an extra mile, and
                created two libraries which you can call to
                <strong>optimally</strong> find desired
                <code>region-of-interest</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The added advantage of using this library is that you can play
                around with the widget in your jupyter notebook, all you have to
                do is grant Google Earth Engine permissions to your google cloud
                platform so that it can render your desired results.
